## Reentry Planner

Simulation of ballistic (Mercury) and aerodynamic reentry (Space Shuttle). Pulling from a variety of documentation/tutorials for this. 
This is a personal project to learn how to built 6DoF reentry sims and apply my knowledge of numerical integration and solving.

## Ballistic Reentry

This type of reentry assumes zero-lift, so the only forces acting on the vehicle are gravity and drag. For ballistic reentry, 
we will be using a Mercury mission as our simulation example.

## Aerodynamic Reentry

This type of reentry uses aerodynamic forces to control the vehicle during reentry. A great example is the Space Shuttle.
