## Reentry Planner

Simulation of ballistic (Mercury) and aerodynamic reentry (Space Shuttle). Pulling from a variety of documentation/tutorials for this. 
This is a personal project to learn how to built 6DoF reentry sims and apply my knowledge of numerical integration and solving. I'm beginning both with some high level path planning and developing the state models and numerical integrators that will be employed in running the simulations.

## Ballistic Reentry

This type of reentry assumes zero-lift, so the only forces acting on the vehicle are gravity and drag. For ballistic reentry, 
we will be using a Mercury mission as our simulation example.

## Aerodynamic Reentry

This type of reentry uses aerodynamic forces to control the vehicle during reentry. A great example is the Space Shuttle.
